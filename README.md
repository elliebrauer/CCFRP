Summaries of the [California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program](https://www.ccfrp.org/) used for stock assessments

# Description    
The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP) is the only statewide hook-and-line survey for the nearshore fisheries in California.  



# Notes on length data
- Each university partner measures fish using different methods    
- The length data within the database and in this repo have not be standardized
- The total length column contains lengths other than total length

**Total Length**: Scripps (SIO), University of Califronia Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Moss Landing Marine Labs (MLML) measure total length, 
allowing the caudal fin to splay naturally.        
**Fork Lengths**: Cal Poly (CP) and University of California Davis Bodega Marine Lab (BML) meaure fork length.       
**Total and pinched tail lengths**: Cal Poly Humboldt, formerly Humboldt State University (HSU) pinches the tail for species with a forked tail and 
takes natural splay/total length for fan tailed species. Awaiting a list of species for each measurement type from HSU.
