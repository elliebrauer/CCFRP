\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

This document summarizes the data from the California Collaborative
Fisheries Research Program (CCFRP), a survey that monitors groundfish populations
in California's network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and adjacent reference areas.
Preliminary analyses suggest the following data availability to inform stock
assessments for each species:

\textbf{Black rockfish (\emph{Sebastes melanops})}: There are enough data to consider an
index of abundance and also include ages in the assessment model north of Point
Conception. An exploration of an index could be considered if California is
modeled as one area. Black rockfish are present in a high proportion of the fishing drops
at the one MPA north of the $40^\circ 10^\prime N. lat.$ management line. However, this area was added in
2017 and represents a shortened time series. There are likely enough otoliths available
to include ages in the assessment model if California is modeled as a single area, and to
inform growth externally north of $40^\circ 10^\prime N. lat.$ if the assessment is split at the management
boundary.

\textbf{Copper rockfish (\emph{S. caurinus})}: There are enough data north of Point Conception
to consider an index of abundance. The two MPAs south of Point Conception with consistent encounters
of copper rockfish cover a very small fraction of the available habitat and were not
included in the original sampling design. There are enough age data available north
of Point Conception for inclusion in an assessment model. Otoliths will be
collected south of Point Conception in 2022.

\textbf{Quillback rockfish (\emph{S. maliger})}: There is only one MPA monitored north of the $40^\circ 10^\prime N. lat.$ management
boundary in California that was not part of the original sampling design and hence
does not have a long time series. It is not likely that robust index can be developed
from the sparse data separately north and south of $40^\circ 10^\prime N. lat.$. An exploration of an index
could be considered if California is modeled as one area. Age data are available
that could inform growth external to the assessment model.

\textbf{Yellowtail rockfish (\emph{S. flavidus})}: There are enough data to consider an index of abundance north of
Point Conception for yellowtail rockfish as well as include age data from the otoliths
within the assessment model.

\section{Survey Background}\label{survey-background}}

The 1999 Marine Life Protection Act resulted in the creation of a network of
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along California's coast. The state of California
designated both State Marine Reserves (SMRs) and State Marine Recreational
Management areas (SMCAs). The SMRs prohibit all recreational and commercial take
and SMCAs allow some recreational and/or commercial take that varies by SMCA.
A number of MPAs consist of an SMR adjacent to an SMCA, of which the SMR is closer to shore.
The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program,
\href{https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/}{CCFRP},
is a fishery-independent hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish
populations at a series of sampling locations both inside and adjacent to
California's network of MPAs.

The CCFRP survey began in 2007 with California Polytechnic University
San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) and San Jose State University Moss Landing Marine Lab
(Moss Landing) in collaboration with NMFS scientists and the fishing community. The core
area of the survey includes AÃ±o Nuevo SMR and Point Lobos SMR sampled by
Moss Landing, and Point Buchon SMR and Piedras Blancas SMR sampled by Cal Poly (Figure \ref{fig:fig-mpa-map}). In 2017, CCFRP expanded within
California to include four additional partners, Cal Poly Humboldt (formerly Humboldt State
University), University of California Davis' Bodega Marine Lab, University
of California Santa Barbara, and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography.
The CCFRP now monitors 12 MPA and reference area pairs (Table \ref{tab:monitoring}).
Cal Poly Humboldt samples the furthest north sites, which are south of Cape
Mendocino, but north of the management line at $40^\circ 10^\prime N. lat.$. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected the
survey effort, but all partners were able to conduct sampling in 2020 and 2021.

The CCFRP survey design is consistent across all partners. Each MPA and reference
area consists of a number of 500 x 500 m cells that were selected because the contained
appropriate rockfish habitat. The survey was designed as a capture
and release survey, with a sub-study tag/recapture program. Therefore, CCFRP restricts
sampling areas to depths shallower than approximately 120 feet in order to reduce
potential effects of barotrauma. On any given survey
day site cells are randomly selected within a stratum (MPA and/or reference cells).
Commercial passenger fishing vessels (CPFVs) are chartered for the survey and
the captain is allowed to search within the cell for a fishing location.
Due to the nature of the fishery in northern California, Cal Poly Humboldt conducts
sampling aboard 6-pack vessels, and therefore fishes for fewer total angler hours per
year compared to the other partners (Tables \ref{tab:anghrs} and \ref{tab:fishingdrops}). During
a sampling event, each cell is fished for a total of 30-45 minutes by volunteer
anglers. Volunteer anglers are allowed to reel up their lines at any time during a
fishing drop if they think they've hooked fish. Anglers can then re-bait and
continue fishing until the the drop is complete. Each fish encountered
can be linked back to an angler. Each anglers fishes one line, with two hooks.
The jig and bait is assigned to each angler, but an angler may fish with a personal
fishing rod.

All fish encountered are measured to the nearest centimeter (fork length), and the
majority of fish are released or descended to depth.
A total of 58498 fish were tagged
since 2007, and recapture data are available from each partner. Starting in 2017,
at the request of Melissa Monk (NMFS SWFSC), a fraction of the fish encountered
in the reference cells have been retained to collect otoliths and fin clips that
provide needed biological information for nearshore species. In 2022, the goal
is to increase biological collections for commonly encountered species for use
in the 2023 stock assessments.

\hypertarget{available-data-for-indices}{%
\section{Available Data for Indices}\label{available-data-for-indices}}

From 2007-2021 a total of 698 fishing trips
were taken, consisting of 9634 fishing drops. When the CCFRP
expanded in 2017, some MPAs/sites were fished in only one or two years during an
exploratory phase. These included Laguna Beach, the southeast Farallon Islands,
Point Conception and Trinidad, which were excluded from this summary since we
would not include them in a stock assessment.
Fishing drops that drifted outside a cell were also excluded. These site filter
result in an available 7910. The final filter removed
drifts within a cell that were not fished for at least ten minutes within a sampling
occasion, resulting in a total of 7889 fishing
drops available for analyses for stock assessments. The total number of fish
encountered by CCFRP partners and the percent of positive drops by species and MPA
can be found in Tables \ref{tab:totalfishbygroup} - \ref{tab:percentpos}.

\hypertarget{available-lengths-and-otoliths}{%
\section{Available Lengths and Otoliths}\label{available-lengths-and-otoliths}}

The CCFRP measures every fish to the nearest centimeter. Distributions of fish
lengths inside and outside the MPAs are in Figures
\ref{fig:lengths-1} - \ref{fig:lengths-4}. Length data were
filtered to the drifts that would be used to develop indices of abaundacne.
Any species and site (MPA or reference) combination with fewer than 20 observed
fish over the entirety of the program were not plotted.

The total number of fish retained by university partner can be found in Table
\ref{tab:otoliths}. This represents the maximum number of available otoliths,
which will be verified once the stock assessments for 2023 are selected. The
rule of thumb for including conditional age-at-length samples is a minimum of 30
available fish in a year/fleet stratum. Given this, there are likely not enough
fish from Bodega or Cal Poly to support conditional age-at-lengths for any species.
